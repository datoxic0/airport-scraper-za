# South Africa Airports Scraper
> A high-performance web application designed to scrape and extract airport data, with a focus on South African airports, for reconnaissance and data aggregation.

## 📋 Executive Summary
This web application, dubbed "MIL-SPEC // AIRPORT_SCRAPER," automates the process of collecting airport information from web sources. It allows users to select target sectors (ranging from specific countries like South Africa to entire continents) and initiates a scraping process to gather relevant data. The extracted information can be used for various purposes, including aviation research, logistical planning, or competitive intelligence. The application is built with a modular architecture that facilitates proxy rotation for circumventing anti-scraping measures and local storage for persistence.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Targeted Web Scraping**: Scrapes airport data from specified URLs, offering options for worldwide, continental, and country-specific targets (initially focused on South Africa).
- **Proxy Rotation**: Integrates a proxy rotator to prevent IP blocking and ensure continuous data acquisition.
- **Data Deduplication**: Implements a `Set` to ensure that airport codes are processed only once, preventing duplicates in the final dataset.
- **Modular Design**: Organizes the code into separate modules (e.g., `proxy.js`, `storage.js`, `network.js`) for maintainability and scalability.
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Provides visual feedback on the scraping process through a dynamic status badge and potentially a user interface for displaying the scraped data.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
**Stack:** Standard Web Technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JS)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Rendering/Logic**: DOM manipulation for updating the UI and displaying scraped data.
- **Structure**: Modular JavaScript architecture with separate modules for proxy management, data storage, network requests, UI updates, and scraping logic.

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage
1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/mil-spec-airport-scraper-za.git
   cd mil-spec-airport-scraper-za
   ```
2. **Local Execution**:
   - This is a static web application. Serve the root directory using any static file server.
   ```bash
   # Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Node.js
   npx http-server .
   ```
3. **Open**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
